## Why Use Robot Framework?

**Keyword-Driven Testing:**  
The Robot Framework utilizes a keyword-driven testing approach, which allows users to create tests using high-level keywords that represent actions. This makes the tests more readable and understandable, facilitating collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders in the development process.

**Rich Ecosystem of Libraries:**  
The framework comes with a vast selection of built-in libraries and supports user-contributed libraries for various testing needs. This allows testers to perform web testing, API testing, database testing, and more, ensuring comprehensive test coverage across different application layers.

**Clear and Informative Reporting:**  
After executing tests, Robot Framework generates detailed and user-friendly reports and logs. These reports provide insights into test results, execution times, and any failures, enabling teams to identify issues quickly and effectively, which is crucial for maintaining high software quality.
